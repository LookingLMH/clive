clive/x keeps externals software retrieved using go get,
that we changed to use import paths of the form
	clive/x/<whatever-the-import-path-was>

We did this to survive updates of the external packages used by clive,
because their authors might change their software and that might
break clive.

See each directory/package for its license and authorship.
