In wr, we shouldn't use OS to run external commands.
Use a wrapper for that, and use Put to create files even for external
commands, or we won't be able to run them through zx connections
and will require sshfs

Even better, make wr produce all the output in stdout, even if it's multiple files,
and then let pf write them back to disk
