open http://lsub.org/ls/clive.html
to see what's in here and how to use it.

This contains the lsub go packages for clive, which
require the go compiler from lsub with modified chans and doselect.

IMPORTANT:
	Unless you checkout the dist tag from this repo, the source might
	not even compile: it's our development git and we push things
	whlie we are writing them, so they might not even compile, or
	they might fail.
	The dist tag is the last pushed tree that should be ok, so use that one.

To get documentation for packages you should, for example,

	godoc -ex -notes 'BUG|REFERENCE' clive/nchan 

so you get examples, and the BUGS and REFERENCES sections.

To install the compiler see ../../golang/guide
We use the "lsub" branch.

To install clive see ./guide
We use the "master" branch.
