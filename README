open http://lsub.org/ls/clive.html
to see what's in here and how to use it.

This contains the lsub go packages for clive, which
require the go compiler from lsub with modified chans and doselect.

IMPORTANT:
	Unless you checkout the dist tag from this repo, the source might
	not even compile: it's our development git and we push things
	whlie we are writing them, so they might not even compile, or
	they might fail.
	The dist tag is the last pushed tree that should be ok, so use that one.


The fmt and doc tools have been modified for Clive in the lsub go compiler.
To get documentation for packages you should, for example,

	go doc -m ...

and that prints the manual page for ...

To fmt the code we use the -S flag (which leverages shorthands
introduced by lsub go in some declarations).

In the lsub go we use the lsub branch, but in clive, we use the
master branch.
